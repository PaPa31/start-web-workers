<!-- This section introduces shared workers using a Hello World example. Shared workers use slightly different APIs, since each worker can have multiple connections. -->

<!-- This first example shows how you connect to a worker and how a worker can send a message back to the page when it connects to it. Received messages are displayed in a log. -->
